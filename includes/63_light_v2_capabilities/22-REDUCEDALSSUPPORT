<p>Whether the device supports the Advanced Lighting Scenes agent, excluding multi-action scene elements.</p>

<p>This capability has been greatly improved for 3.3.2. Most drivers should use this reduced_als_support capability as it provides 99% of all lighting scene functionality and doesn&#39;t require the driver to implement any ALS API&#39;s.</p>

<p>The primary downside of reduced ALS support is the lack of multi-action scene elements.</p>

<p>Drivers using this capability will receive SET_BRIGHTNESS_TARGET and SET_COLOR_TARGET, SET_BRIGHTNESS_STOP, and SET_COLOR_STOP commands when a scene is activated rather than ALS API commands.</p>

<p>Drivers should verify that scene ramping via a held scene ramp up/down button works with their drivers via the supports_target capability and properly handle SET_COLOR_STOP and SET_BRIGHTNESS_STOP commands.</p>

<p>Note: This cannot be enabled if advanced_scene_support is enabled.</p>
