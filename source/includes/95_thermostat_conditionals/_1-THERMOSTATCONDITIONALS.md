## THERMOSTAT CONDITIONALS

The following Conditionals are supported with the Thermostat Proxy and can be used in ComposerPro Programming.

`IF_TEMPERATURE` - simple integer test to see if the current temperature is a supplied value. No manipulation is done on the units for the temperature. If the thermostat is configured to be celsius, the value to compare it with should be in Celsius as well.

`IF_HEAT_SETPOINT` - simple integer test against the current heat setpoint.

`IF_COOL_SETPOINT` - simple integer test against the current cool setpoint.

`IF_HVAC_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the HVAC is in a given mode.

`IF_FAN_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the fan is in a given mode.

`IF_HOLD_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the hold mode is in a given mode.

`IF_HVAC_STATE` - simple boolean test to see if the HVAC is in a given state.

`IF_FAN_STATE` - simple boolean test to see if the fan is in a given state.

`IF_VACATION_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the vacation mode is on/off.

`IF_OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE` - simple integer test to see if the current temperature is a supplied value. Not manipulation is done on the units for the temperature. If the thermostat is configured to be Celsius, the value to compare it with should be in Celsius as well.

`IF_HEAT_SETPOINT` - simple integer test against the current heat setpoint.

`IF_COOL_SETPOINT` - simple integer test against the current cool setpoint.

`IF_HVAC_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the HVAC is in a given mode.

`IF_FAN_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the fan is in a given mode.

`IF_HOLD_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the hold mode is in a given mode.

`IF_HVAC_STATE` - simple boolean test to see if the HVAC is in a given state.

`IF_FAN_STATE` - simple boolean test to see if the fan is in a given state.

`IF_VACATION_MODE` - simple boolean test to see if the vacation mode is on/off.

`IF_OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE` - simple integer test to see if the current temperature is a supplied value.

`IF_HUMIDITY_MODE` - simple boolean test on a string to see if the humidity mode is in a given mode.

`IF_HUMIDITY_STATE` - simple boolean test on a string to see if the humidity state is in a given mode.

`IF_HUMIDIFY_SETPOINT` - simple integer test on an int number to see if the current humidify setpoint is a supplied value.

`IF_HUMIDITY_MODE` - simple boolean test on a string to see if the humidity mode is in a given mode.

`IF_HUMIDITY_STATE` - simple boolean test on a string to see if the humidity state is in a given mode.

`IF_HUMIDIFY_SETPOINT` - simple integer test on an int number to see if the current humidify setpoint is a supplied value.

`IF_MESSAGE` - simple boolean test to see if the HVAC is in a given mode.

`IF_PRESET` - simple boolean test to see if the preset is in a given name.
