## SET\_BRIGHTNESS\_RATE\_DEFAULT

This is used by old(deprecated) generic On/Off commands, Navigators, and user created lighting scenes.

When this value is changed, drivers will receive a protocol driver command of UPDATE\_BRIGHTNESS\_RATE\_DEFAULT with a parameter RATE of the value.

Note: If a driver has its color rate behavior set to be linked to the brightness rate, then this call will also update the color rate.
