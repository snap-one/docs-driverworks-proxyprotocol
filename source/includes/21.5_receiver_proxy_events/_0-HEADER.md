# Audio Output Bindings and Proxy Events

Note: Audio Output binding ID values defined in drivers written in conjunction with this Proxy must start with a binding value of 4000. The acceptable range for Audio Outputs is 4000 - 4999. However, if the first output binding ID value is not 4000, issues with Proxy Events firing correctly can be encountered.

For a list of valid Binding ID values as well as information on favoriting and blocking connection classes, please see the [Connections][1] section of the DriverWorks Fundamentals Guide.
