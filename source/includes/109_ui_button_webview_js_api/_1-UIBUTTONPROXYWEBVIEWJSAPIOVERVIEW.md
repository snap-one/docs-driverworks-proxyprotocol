## API OVERVIEW

Navigator Version 321.20+

The Java Script API included with the UI Button proxy allows Driver hosted web views to send commands, subscribe to DATA\_TO\_UIs and variables using the existing mobile communication channels. This enables UI Button web views to work remotely. Previous versions of web views only worked on Control4 touchscreens residing on the local network. 

Note that these API calls can only be made to the driver/protocol hosting the web page. UI Buttons pointing to external web pages will not be able to access the Javascript API.
